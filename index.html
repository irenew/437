      <h1>Project Overview:</h1>

      <p>By definition, when there is excessive amount of noise that disrupts the natural
balance would be considered as noise pollution. Noise pollution within a household
is one of the most underrated form of pollution, and it is often caused by excessive
use of electronic households and water. It not only affect the environment but also
humanâ€™s health state (hearing impairment, sleep disturbances). Moreover, People tend
to react to noise pollution in form of producing more noise, rather than attempting to
lower the noise level. This is why we are producing a kinetic sculpture that mimics how
the nature would communicate to us about noise pollution within the indoor environment.
To promote sustainable living, our goal of this project is to promote awareness regarding
the usage of water and electricity within the household. </p>
