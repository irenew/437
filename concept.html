          <h1>PROJECT CONCEPT</h1>

          <p>By definition, when there is an excessive amount of noise which disrupts the ambient noise levels, it would be considered as noise pollution. Within many communities, noise pollution often goes unnoticed. A form of pollution that can be very dangerous, people belittle the fact that noise pollution can be just as harmful as any other form of pollution. The damage from noise pollution is built up gradually like any other type of pollution. However the effects of noise pollutions happens within the body which make it easier to go on unnoticed. These harmful effects can be caused by everyday objects like household appliances. The impact of the damage may seem very little at first, until it gradually builds up and ruptures a personâ€™s eardrums.  Therefore, to promote a sustainable living, and to lessen the amount of noise pollution within our community, we built Suona, a kinetic sculpture that communicates to its audience about the noise pollution level within its environment. To make sounds visible and understandable to the audience, our kinetic sculpture will respond to the different levels of noise as well as the volume of noise. Displays through LEDs, and physical rotation will reveal not how harmful certain noises can be but also where that noise is coming from. The form of our kinetic sculpture resembles that of an aircraft turbine engine. Aircraft turbines; being one of most harmful sources of noise put into contrast with our kinetic sculpture, which warns people about harmful noises, is what creates the irony in our product. </p>
